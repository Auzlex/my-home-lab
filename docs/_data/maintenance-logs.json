    "status": "resolved",
    "category": "active",
    "problem_description": "LORIC (Raspberry Pi 3 B+ orchestration node) did not respond after a reboot. The device was unreachable over the network, and the Gitea runner service on it was offline.",
    "diagnosis_steps": "1. Connected Ethernet cable directly to LORIC to establish connectivity and investigate:\n   <pre><code>ip a</code></pre>\n\n2. Examined wireless interface status:\n   <pre><code>ifconfig wlan0</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Findings:</strong>\n- The Raspberry Pi had forgotten the WiFi SSID and had no active wireless connection.\n- Even after Ethernet connectivity was restored, the Gitea runner service failed to start due to DNS resolution issues.",
    "resolution": "1. Reconfigured WiFi settings using Raspberry Pi configuration tool:\n   <pre><code>sudo raspi-config</code></pre>\n   - Select <strong>System Options</strong> > <strong>Wireless LAN</strong>\n   - Enter correct SSID and passphrase\n   - Save and reboot\n\n2. Fixed local DNS resolution to allow the runner service to start:\n   <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/hosts</code></pre>\n   Added entries for all relevant nodes.\n\n3. Restarted Gitea runner:\n   <pre><code>sudo systemctl restart gitea-runner\nsudo systemctl status gitea-runner</code></pre>\n\nLORIC reconnected to the network and the runner service resumed normal operation.",
    "follow_up_notes": [
      "Keep an eye on LORIC’s WiFi over the next few days to make sure it stays stable.",
      "Make sure all Pi nodes have persistent DNS entries so the runner can always find what it needs.",
      "For critical services, consider keeping a backup Ethernet connection ready.",
      "Watch the runner logs for any future failures that might be network-related."

    "status": "resolved",
    "category": "active",
    "problem_description": "The /etc/hosts file was being reset after system reboots, losing custom DNS resolutions including casper.local entries.",
    "diagnosis_steps": "Investigated the cause of hosts file resetting:\n\n1. Checked cloud-init configuration:\n   <pre><code>cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg</code></pre>\n\n2. Examined hosts template file:\n   <pre><code>cat /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.debian.tmpl</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Findings:</strong> Cloud-init was managing /etc/hosts and overwriting custom entries on each boot.",
    "resolution": "Disabled cloud-init management of /etc/hosts and updated the template:\n\n1. Edited cloud-init configuration:\n   <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg</code></pre>\n   Set: <code>manage_etc_hosts: false</code>\n\n2. Updated hosts template to include DNS resolution:\n   <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.debian.tmpl</code></pre>\n   Added: <code>192.168.1.120 casper.local casper</code>\n\n3. Rebooted system to verify changes persist:\n   <pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>\n\nThe /etc/hosts file now retains custom entries across reboots.",
    "follow_up_notes": [
      "Double-check that casper.local actually resolves after a reboot.",
      "Look at the other Pis to make sure they don’t have the same cloud-init issue.",
      "Keep a note of this fix for future setups so it doesn’t catch you off guard.",
      "Watch for any weird behavior from cloud-init in the coming weeks."

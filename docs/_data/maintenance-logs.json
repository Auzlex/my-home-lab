    "status": "resolved",
    "category": "active",
    "problem_description": "LORIC (Raspberry Pi 3 B+ orchestration node) did not respond after a reboot this morning. The device was unreachable over the network.",
    "diagnosis_steps": "Connected Ethernet cable directly to LORIC to establish connectivity and investigate:\n\n1. Checked network interfaces:\n   <pre><code>ip a</code></pre>\n\n2. Examined wireless interface status:\n   <pre><code>ifconfig wlan0</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Findings:</strong> The Raspberry Pi configuration had forgotten the WiFi network SSID and had no active wireless connection.",
    "resolution": "Reconfigured WiFi settings using the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:\n<pre><code>sudo raspi-config</code></pre>\n\nNavigation steps:\n- Select <strong>System Options</strong> > <strong>Wireless LAN</strong>\n- Enter the correct SSID and passphrase\n- Save and exit raspi-config\n- Reboot the device\n\nLORIC successfully reconnected to the network and resumed normal operation.",
    "follow_up_notes": "- Monitor LORIC's WiFi stability in the coming weeks\n- Check if this issue affects other Raspberry Pi devices (CASPER, AUREL)\n- Consider implementing more robust WiFi configuration or fallback to Ethernet for critical nodes\n- Investigate potential causes: power fluctuations, configuration corruption, or hardware issues"

    "status": "resolved",
    "category": "active",
    "problem_description": "The /etc/hosts file was being reset after system reboots, losing custom DNS resolutions including casper.local entries.",
    "diagnosis_steps": "Investigated the cause of hosts file resetting:\n\n1. Checked cloud-init configuration:\n   <pre><code>cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg</code></pre>\n\n2. Examined hosts template file:\n   <pre><code>cat /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.debian.tmpl</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Findings:</strong> Cloud-init was managing /etc/hosts and overwriting custom entries on each boot.",
    "resolution": "Disabled cloud-init management of /etc/hosts and updated the template:\n\n1. Edited cloud-init configuration:\n   <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg</code></pre>\n   Set: <code>manage_etc_hosts: false</code>\n\n2. Updated hosts template to include DNS resolution:\n   <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.debian.tmpl</code></pre>\n   Added: <code>192.168.1.120 casper.local casper</code>\n\n3. Rebooted system to verify changes persist:\n   <pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>\n\nThe /etc/hosts file now retains custom entries across reboots.",
    "follow_up_notes": "- Verify that casper.local resolves correctly after reboot\n- Check if other Raspberry Pi devices have similar cloud-init configurations\n- Consider documenting this configuration for future device setups\n- Monitor for any cloud-init related issues in the future"

    "description": "ENLIL is a dedicated Raspberry Pi device intended to run Pi-hole, a network-wide ad blocker and DNS sinkhole. This will provide network-level ad blocking and improve privacy across all devices in the home lab network.",
    "planned_setup_steps": "1. <strong>Initial Setup</strong>\n   - Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to SD card\n   - Configure hostname as \"ENLIL\"\n   - Set static IP address in home network range\n   - Enable SSH and update system\n\n2. <strong>Pi-hole Installation</strong>\n   <pre><code>curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</code></pre>\n\n3. <strong>Configuration</strong>\n   - Set upstream DNS servers (Cloudflare, Google, or local)\n   - Configure DHCP settings if needed\n   - Set up admin interface password\n   - Enable web interface\n\n4. <strong>Network Integration</strong>\n   - Update router DNS settings to point to ENLIL's IP\n   - Test ad blocking functionality\n   - Configure device whitelisting if needed",
    "status_detail": "**TODO** - Setup not yet completed. Hardware prepared but software installation pending.",
    "notes": "- ENLIL will serve as the primary DNS server for the home lab\n- Consider backup DNS configuration for redundancy\n- Monitor network performance impact after deployment"
